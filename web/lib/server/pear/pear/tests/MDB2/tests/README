Configuration
=============
The test suite runs for every DBMS available for which you have supplied
<DBMS>_TEST_* environment variables.  Read dsn.inc for complete information.


Requirements
============
The tests use PHPUnit 3.6.  See www.phpunit.de for more information.


The Test Database
=================
The test suite automatically builds the needed objects.  But if it is
necessary to create the objects manually, follow the instructions in
dsn.inc, then run:

    php import.schema.php


Execution
=========
To run the entire suite, call the following from the directory containing
the tests directory:

    phpunit tests

To run a particular set of tests, name the file to be run, for example:

    phpunit tests/Standard/ApiTest.php
